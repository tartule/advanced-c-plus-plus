# Design pattern - composite
This is a mini C++ project where we simulated a local internet messaging system by using composite design pattern.
// To add more description
## Composite Pattern
'* Why does it exist?

When dealing with <g> Tree-structured data <\g>, one difficulty is that branches and leaves are treated differently, which causes more errors. The solution is an interface that allows treating complex and primitive objects uniformly.

'* What is it used for?

Solve recurring design problems by designing flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

'* Definition:
The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object.
